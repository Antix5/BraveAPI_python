# Brave API python wraper

Description : This code is a simple python wrapper for the brave API.
For now, the project is really simple and allows only to do simple search and get bare output (or get the titles for the pages) but the project is going to get gradualy improved.

The goal at the end is to make this code suitable for data extraction and allow for a simple connection to LLMs and text processing tools.

This wrapper will also certainly be extended to other search tools provided by brave.

**WARNING** : This is NOT an official API project, I don't have any connection to Brave and I'm not responsible for the missuses of this API (for example : exceeded rate limit, accidental DDOS etc...)
